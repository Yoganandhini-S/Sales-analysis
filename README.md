Fiction is the dominant genre across all filters. The Macmillan filter shows the highest extreme of this, with 92.43% of units sold being Fiction.

HarperCollins Publishers shows the most balanced sales mix, with Nonfiction contributing a significant 31.33% of their sales volume, making them a key player in that genre.

3. Historical Trends
